- Project title: `Client Connection App`

- Motivation:
  It's my goal with this app, as it developes and grows, is to create a platform where furries can commission their costumes and costume pieces in a collective and more public space. It's problematic to be in such a massive fandom and handle your business over social media platforms (as is the default, presently). With this app, I want to give the fandom a place where they can skim through designers and select one they feel comfortable with, but all in one place instead of having to remember and search for usernames of designers across other platforms. Here, they have access to viewing all the designers that are a part of the platform and then pursue commissioning them in a simple and clear form. As this app developes further, I have plans to install a `review` functionality that would allow clients to submit reviews on their designer that would display on the designer's profile page. Ideally, this app will help the community clean up some of it's issues with professionalism when it comes to business transactions like these.
